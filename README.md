# gosync

`gosync` is a synchronization package complimentary to Go's standard `sync`
package.

## Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/zhongruoyu/gosync@latest
```

## Usage

The types in `gosync` provides an additional typed interface on top of Go's
standard [`sync`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync) package. They should work just as
they do in the standard library. For more information, see the
[documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zhongruoyu/gosync).
